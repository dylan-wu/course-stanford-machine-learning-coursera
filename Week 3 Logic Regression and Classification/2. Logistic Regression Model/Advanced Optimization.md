**Note:** [7:35 - '100' should be 100 instead. The value provided should be an integer and not a character string.]

"Conjugate gradient", "BFGS", and "L-BFGS" are more sophisticated, faster ways to optimize $\theta$ that can be used instead of gradient descent. We suggest that you should not write these more sophisticated algorithms yourself (unless you are an expert in numerical computing) but use the libraries instead, as they're already tested and highly optimized. Octave provides them.

We first need to provide a function that evaluates the following two functions for a given input value $\theta$:
