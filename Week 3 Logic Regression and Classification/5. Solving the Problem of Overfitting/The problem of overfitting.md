Leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a $y=\theta_0+\theta_1x$ to a dataset. We see the data doesn't exactly lie on the straight line, and so the fit is not that good.

How do we fix this?
- We could add an extra feature $x^2$, and fit $y=\theta_0+\theta_1x+\theta_2x^2$, then we'd obtain a slightly better fit to the data
