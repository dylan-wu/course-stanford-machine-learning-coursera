Let's examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (**dendrites**) as electrical inputs (called "spikes") that are channeled to outputs (**axons**). In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1,...x_n$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our $x_0$ input node is sometimes called the "bias unit." It is
