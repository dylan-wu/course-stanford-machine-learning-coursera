To re-iterate, the following is an example of a neural network:

In this section we'll do a vectorized implementation of the above functions. We're going to define a new variable $z_k^{(j)}$ that encompasses the parameters inside our g function. In our previous example if we replaced by the variable z for all the parameters we would get:
